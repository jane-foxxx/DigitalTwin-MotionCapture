# DigitalTwin-MotionCapture
 A VR Motion Capture System for Third-Person  Perspectives in CAVE

Brief Guideline of DigitalTwin_MoitonCapture Project
1.	Software Used
   * Python 3.11
   * Unity 2020.3.21f1
   * VotanicXR 2020SDK
3.	Python Environment Setting for Mocap
   * Python File is used to open camera and capture frame image of video.
   * Utilize python package such as OpenCV/Mediapipe to capture and identify human pose information, then transfer pose data to unity through UDP.

2.1.	Python File
Download mediapipe, cvzone, opencv-python, opencv-contrib-python in python

2.2.	Executable File
To build an executable file that opens the camera and runs on any computer, regardless of whether it has a Python environment, follow these steps:
1.	Install PyInstaller: Use the command `pip install pyinstaller`.
2.	Prepare your Python script: Ensure your script (e.g., `MotionCap.py`) is ready.
3.	Generate the executable: Run `pyinstaller -F MotionCap.py` in the terminal.
4.	Locate the executable: Find the generated `.exe` file in the `dist` directory.
This process can create an executable file that can be run on any computer without Python installation.

** Remember to change python file/name to your own work

3.	Unity
â€¢	Based on exiting unity file, directly run/build file would be fine
